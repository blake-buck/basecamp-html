		<p id="textDump">Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. 
		It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord
		of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to 
		create life. He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared 
		about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be
		unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which 
		eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then 
		his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself. </p>
